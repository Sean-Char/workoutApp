This TwerkIt app was built with HTML5, CSS3, AngularJS Material, Angular JS 1.x, and wger.de API.  

The app was influenced from going the gym and having to always look up workouts on the cellphone. I built this app for my own personal use. Due to how heavy load times are for the workout sites that I was using, this app totally resolves my issues by giving me an all in one stop shop.

NOTE:
The zip code input for "search a gym" is currently under development.
